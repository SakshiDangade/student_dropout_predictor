# ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Risk Predictor

This project is a **machine learning-powered web app** designed to predict whether a student is likely to **drop out or graduate** based on academic, demographic, and socio-economic features.

It is built with **Python**, trained in **Google Colab**, and deployed using **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ§  Models Trained

Four machine learning models were trained and compared:

- âœ… Logistic Regression *(Best Performer)*
- ðŸŒ² Decision Tree Classifier
- ðŸ“Š K-Nearest Neighbors
- ðŸŒ³ Random Forest Classifier

After testing with accuracy, precision, and recall, **Logistic Regression** performed best and was selected for deployment.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- User-friendly web interface (via Streamlit)
- Predicts student dropout or graduation
- Displays class probabilities
- Allows **CSV** and **PDF downloads** of the prediction
- Clean sidebar UI with dropdowns for better user clarity

## ðŸ“ˆ Input Features

The model uses 30+ features, including:

- Demographic data (e.g., gender, age, marital status)
- Academic records (credits, grades, evaluations)
- Parental education and occupation
- Socio-economic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment)
- Tuition payment status and scholarships

ðŸ§¾ Sample Prediction Output

The app displays the predicted class and probabilities like:

ðŸŸ¢ Likely to Graduate (Probability: 82.15%)
ðŸ”´ Likely to Dropout (Probability: 17.85%)

And allows downloading the result as:

-CSV File
-PDF Report

ðŸ“š Learnings

-Model comparison and evaluation
-Handling label-encoded categorical features
-Model serialization using joblib
-Real-time web deployment with Streamlit
-Improving user experience with readable labels and dropdowns
